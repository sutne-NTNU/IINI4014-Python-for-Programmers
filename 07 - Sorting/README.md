# Sorting
Start by reading about sorting algorithms: https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/SortSearch/toctree.html

The task is to use a sorting algorithm to sort a list of strings (from a data file) by increasing length, and such that strings of the same length are sorted lexicographically.

## Results
If i were to implement this i would have inserted the words in the correct position while reading them from the file, but because the assignment specifically asks to use a sorting algorithm i decided to first implement `bubblesort` which is quick and easy, but as we all know, very slow. So i also implemented `mergesort` as i haven't implemented this sorting algorithm before. As an extra challenge i wanted to see if i could do it without creating any other arrays than the one given (using only in-place swaps).  

I decided to time each sorting algorithm and comparing them that way:
```console
Number of words to sort: 12562 

Bubblesort used: 36 seconds
Mergesort used: 2 seconds
``` 
As we can see, this is quite a big difference. Mergesort being 18 times faster than bubblesort (a difference that just gets bigger as the number of words increase).

After using both algorithms like this: 
```python
bubble = getArrayFromFile("data/Great Expectations.txt")
print("Number of words to sort:", len(bubble), "\n")
bubbleSort(bubble)

merge = getArrayFromFile("data/Great Expectations.txt")
mergeSort(merge)
```
*note that i have to read the array from the file two times, as both algorithms use in-place sorting.*

I get the folowing sorted array back (this is just small excerpts of it):
